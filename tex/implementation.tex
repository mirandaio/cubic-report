\section{Implementation}
  This new mechanism for creating the p-stream was implemented in ns-2. A 
  function called create\_cubic\_stream calculates the sending rates of each 
  packet using equations 15 and 16. Then, the gaps between each packet were
  calculated by dividing the size of the packet $P$ by the corresponding rate 
  ${r_k}$.
